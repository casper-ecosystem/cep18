# Casper Fungible Tokens (CEP-18 Standard)

This repository contains a reference contract implementation and tests for fungible tokens on a Casper network, following the [CEP-18 standard](https://github.com/casper-network/ceps/pull/18).

## Preparation

Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Rust target with the following command.

```
make prepare
```

## Building and Testing the Contract

To build the reference fungible token contract and supporting tests, run this command:

```
make test
```

## Locating the Contract Wasm

Find the Wasm for the contract in the following directory:

```
casper/cep18/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cep18_token.wasm
```

## A JavaScript Client SDK

A [JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18/tree/master/client-js#readme) has been provided to interact with the fungible token contract.
