# Casper Fungible Token Tutorial

This tutorial introduces an implementation of the CEP-18 standard for the Casper blockchain, known as the Casper Fungible Token. The code for this tutorial is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18).

The [Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC-20)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#specification) standard is an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem. This standard allows for building new tokens based on smart contracts. These ERC-20 tokens are blockchain-based assets that have value and can be transferred or recorded.

The Casper Fungible Token standard is the Casper Platform's ER-C20 equivalent. It defines a set of rules that dictate the total supply of tokens, how the tokens are transferred, how transactions are approved, and how token data is accessed.

The following functions implement the rules defined by Casper Fungible Tokens: `totalSupply`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `balanceOf`, and `allowance`. A portion of this tutorial reviews the [contract](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18/blob/master/cep18/src/main.rs) and the [casper_fungible_token](https://docs.rs/casper-erc20-crate/latest/casper_erc20_crate/) library.

The [Writing Rust Contracts on Casper](https://docs.casper.network/developers/writing-onchain-code/simple-contract/) document outlines many aspects of this tutorial and should be read first.

# Preparation

First clone the contract from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18 && cd cep18
```

Prepare your environment with the following command:

```bash
make prepare
```

If your environment is set up correctly, you will see this output:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
info: component 'rust-std' for target 'wasm32-unknown-unknown' is up to date
```

If you do not see this message, check the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.casper.network/developers/writing-onchain-code/getting-started/).

Next, compile your contract and run the contract unit tests.

```bash
make build-contract
make test
```

# Contract Implementation

In [GitHub](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18), you will find a library and an [example implementation](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18/blob/master/cep18/src/main.rs) of the Fungible Token for Casper networks. This section explains the example contract in more detail.

There are four steps to follow when you intend to create your own implementation of the Fungible Token contract, as follows:

1.  Fork the code from the example repository listed above.
2.  Perform any customization changes necessary on your personal fork of the example contract.
3.  Compile the customized code to Wasm.
4.  Send the customized Wasm as a deploy to a Casper network.

## Installing Required Crates {#installing-crates}

This tutorial applies to the Rust implementation of the Casper Fungible Token standard, and requires the following Casper crates:

- [casper_contract](https://docs.rs/casper-contract/latest/casper_contract/index.html) - A Rust library for writing smart contracts on Casper networks
- [casper_types](https://docs.rs/casper-types/latest/casper_types/) - Types used to allow creation of Wasm contracts and tests for use on Casper networks
- [casper_erc20](https://docs.rs/casper-erc20-crate/latest/casper_erc20_crate/) - A library for developing Fungible Tokens for Casper networks

Here is the code snippet which imports those crates:

```rust

use casper_contract::{contract_api::runtime, unwrap_or_revert::UnwrapOrRevert};

use casper_types::{CLValue, U256};

```

**Note**: In Rust, the keyword `use` is like an include statement in C/C++.

## Initializing the Contract {#initializing-the-contract}

Initializing the contract happens through the `call()` function inside the [contract file](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18/blob/master/cep18/src/main.rs). When you deploy the contract, you need to initialize it with a `call()` function and define `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, and `total_supply`.

The code snippet for initializing the contract should look like this:

```rust

#[no_mangle]
fn call() {
  let name: String = runtime::get_named_arg(NAME_RUNTIME_ARG_NAME);
  let symbol: String = runtime::get_named_arg(SYMBOL_RUNTIME_ARG_NAME);
  let decimals = runtime::get_named_arg(DECIMALS_RUNTIME_ARG_NAME);
  let total_supply = runtime::get_named_arg(TOTAL_SUPPLY_RUNTIME_ARG_NAME);

  let _token = CEP18::install(name, symbol, decimals, total_supply).unwrap_or_revert();
}

```

## Contract Methods {#contract-methods}

This section briefly explains the contract methods used in the Casper Fungible Token contract.

To see the full implementation of the below contract methods, refer to the [contract file](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18/blob/master/cep18/src/main.rs) in Github. If you have any questions, review the [casper_erc20](https://docs.rs/casper-erc20-crate/latest/casper_erc20_crate/) library and the [EIP-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md#) standard.

Also, for further unresolved issues please contact the Casper support team via the [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/Q38s3Vh).

# Installing the Contract

After customizing your instance of the CEP-18 token contract, it's time to install it in global state. Installing the Fungible Token contract is similar to installing other smart contracts, while only the Wasm files and parameters will differ. Refer to the [Sending Deploys to a Casper network using the Rust Client](https://docs.casper.network/developers/dapps/sending-deploys/) section to learn more about install contracts.

## Deploy Prerequisites {#deploy-prerequisites}

- Set up your machine as per the [prerequisites](https://docs.casper.network/developers/prerequisites/)
- Ensure you have [set up an account](https://docs.casper.network/concepts/accounts-and-keys/#creating-accounts-and-keys) with a public and secret key pair to initiate the deploy
- Since we are deploying to the Casper Testnet, ensure your [Testnet faucet account](https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/faucet) contains enough CSPR tokens to perform the contract execution. Follow the guide to [fund your account](https://docs.casper.network/developers/prerequisites/#fund-your-account) or to [transfer tokens](https://docs.casper.network/developers/cli/transfers/) as needed
- Install the [Casper command-line client](https://docs.casper.network/developers/prerequisites/#install-casper-client) to interact with the network

## Basic Flow {#basic-flow}

Here are the basic steps to install the Casper Fungible Token contract on a Casper Network.

- [Clone the contract](#cloning-the-token-contract-cloning-the-token-contract)
- [Get the IP address of a node](#getting-an-ip-address-from-a-testnet-peer-getting-an-ip-address)
- [View the network state](#viewing-the-network-status-viewing-network-status)
- [Install the contract via a deploy](#installing-the-contract-deploying-the-contract)
- [View the network state](#querying-the-network-status-querying-the-network-status)

## Cloning the Token Contract {#cloning-the-token-contract}

This step includes cloning and preparing the token contract for the deployment.

1. Clone the Fungible Token contract from the repository.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18.git

```

2. Make any necessary changes to the code for your customization requirements.

3. Compile the contract to create the target .wasm file and build the Wasm.

```bash

cd cep18
make prepare
make build-contracts

```

4. Build and verify the compiled contract.

```bash

make test

```

## Getting an IP Address from a Testnet Peer {#getting-an-ip-address}

We will use a Testnet [peer](https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/peers) to send the deploy. Read the guide to [acquiring a node address](https://docs.casper.network/developers/prerequisites/#acquire-node-address-from-network-peers) if needed.

## Viewing the Network Status {#viewing-network-status}

This query captures any information related to the state of the blockchain at the specific time denoted by the network's state root hash. You need to have the state root hash and the account hash to run the query.

**Getting the state root hash**

Get the state root hash, which marks a snapshot of the network state at a moment in time. Use the [Node IP address](https://docs.casper.network/developers/prerequisites/#acquire-node-address-from-network-peers) taken from a Testnet peer.

```bash
casper-client get-state-root-hash --node-address http://<HOST:PORT>
```

**Getting the account hash**

Run the following command and supply the path to your public key in hexadecimal format to get the account hash.

```bash
casper-client account-address --public-key "[PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY]/public_key_hex"
```

**Querying global state**

Use the command template below to query the network status with regard to your account.

```bash
casper-client query-global-state \
--node-address http://<HOST:PORT> \
--state-root-hash [STATE_ROOT_HASH] \
--key [ACCOUNT_HASH]
```

## Installing the Contract {#deploying-the-contract}

Now you can install the contract to the network and check how it behaves.

If you are sending the deploy on Mainnet, try several put deploys on the Testnet to understand the exact gas amount required for that deploy. Refer to the [note about gas price](https://docs.casper.network/developers/dapps/sending-deploys/#a-note-about-gas-price) to understand more about payment amounts and gas price adjustments.

Casper's Peregrine update introduced a refund system. In the event of overpay, 99% of unspent funds will be refunded. The refund only takes into account overpay after the actual gas cost of the Deploy in question.

Use the following command template to deploy the contract:

```bash
casper-client put-deploy \
    --node-address http://<HOST:PORT> \
    --chain-name [NETWORK_NAME]] \
    --secret-key [PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY]/secret_key.pem \
    --payment-amount [AMOUNT] \
    --session-path [WASM_FILE_PATH]/[File_Name].wasm
    --session-arg <"NAME:TYPE='VALUE'" OR "NAME:TYPE=null">
```

- `NETWORK_NAME`: Use the relevant network name. Here we use '_casper-test_'
- `PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY`: Replace this with the actual path of your secret key
- `PAYMENT_AMOUNT`: Gas amount in tokens needed for contract execution. If there are no adequate tokens, the deploy will not execute and will return an error
- `WASM FILE PATH`: The session-path argument should point to the location of your compiled Fungible Token Wasm file

Here is a sample _put-deploy_ command:

```bash
casper-client put-deploy \
--node-address http://95.216.24.237:7777 \
--chain-name casper-test \
--secret-key "/home/ubuntu/secret_key.pem" \
--payment-amount 300000000000 \
--session-path "<machine-path>/cep18/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cep18.wasm" \
--session-arg "name:string='Token test'" \
--session-arg "symbol:string='TEST'" \
--session-arg "total_supply:u256='1000'" \
--session-arg "decimals:u8='10'"
```

**_Note:_**
Please be advised that the deployment cost is subject to change periodically. Before installing the contract on the main network, we strongly recommend verifying the payment amount.

## Querying the Network Status {#querying-the-network-status}

You will need the newest state root hash to view the network status, as it changed with the deploy. The account hash remains the same since you are using the same account. Follow the [viewing the network state](#viewing-the-network-status) section to execute this step with the new state root hash.

## Verifying the Deploy {#verifying-the-deploy}

Now you can verify the sent deploy using the `get-deploy` command. This will output the details of the sent deploy.

```bash
casper-client get-deploy \
--node-address http://<HOST:PORT> [DEPLOY_HASH]
```

## Querying with Arguments {#querying-with-arguments}

This step will narrow down the context and check the status of a specific entry point. You will use the details inside the [Fungible Token contract](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18/blob/master/cep18/src/main.rs) to derive arguments.

Use the command template below to query the network state with arguments:

```bash
casper-client query-global-state \
--node-address http://<HOST:PORT> \
--state-root-hash [STATE_ROOT_HASH] \
--key [ACCOUNT_HASH] \
-q "[CONTRACT_NAME/ARGUMENT]"
```

## Example Deploy on Testnet {#sample-deploy-testnet}

The following steps will guide you through the process with sample values and results.

### Cloning the Fungible Token Contract

```bash
git clone https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep18.git
```

### Getting an IP Address from a Testnet Peer

Use [peers](https://testnet.cspr.live/tools/peers) to get the node IP address.

### Viewing the Network Status

Here is the command to query the state of the network:

```bash
casper-client query-global-state \
--key account-hash-<account-address> \
--node-address http://<HOST:PORT> \
--state-root-hash E5B679BD1562fE6257257F5f969A79482E8DCEBBD501501BfA6d5844b61cBE3f
```

**Result**:

This result contains the network state before the deploy. You can see the `named-key` field is empty since we haven't sent the deploy to the network yet.

    }
  }
}
```

</details>
<br></br>

### Sending the Deploy

Send the Deploy containing your contract with this command:

```bash
casper-client put-deploy \
--node-address http://<HOST:PORT>  \
--chain-name casper-test \
--secret-key "/home/ubuntu/secret_key.pem" \
--payment-amount 1000000 \
--session-path "<machine-path>/cep18/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cep18.wasm" \ 
--session-arg "name:string='Token test'" \
--session-arg "symbol:string='TEST'" \
--session-arg "total_supply:u256='1000'" \
--session-arg "decimals:u8='10'"
```

**_Note:_**
Please be advised that the deployment cost is subject to change periodically. Before installing the contract on the main network, we strongly recommend verifying the payment amount.

**Result**:

This command execution will output the `deploy_hash` of the applied deploy. We can use the deploy_hash to get the details of the deploy.

```bash
{
  "id": 931694842944790108,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "api_version": "1.4.3",
    "deploy_hash": "b00E59f8aBA5c7aB9...."
  }
}
```

### Viewing the Deploy Details

You can view the details of the sent deploy using the command below:

```bash
casper-client get-deploy \
--node-address http://<HOST:PORT> \
b00E59f8aBA5c7aB9.....
```

**Result**:

This contains the header, payment, and session details along with the execution results.

- If the execution result field appears as `"execution_results":[]`, it means that the deploy hasn't been executed yet. The time to load the execution result may vary depending on the network.

### Querying Contract Entry Points

We will query the argument 'name' in this example.

```bash
casper-client query-global-state --node-address http://95.216.24.237:7777 \
--state-root-hash D00dF8c35B0E9995c2911803F37A212d82c960D9bC5bA3C4F99a661e18D09411 \
--key account-hash-7f4bf39A311a7538d8C91BB86C71DF774023e16bc4a70ab7e4e8AE77DbF2Ef53 \
-q "test_contract/name"
```

**Result**:

You can see that the name is `CasperTest` in this example.

```bash
{
 "id": -3650676146668320186,
 "jsonrpc": "2.0",
 "result": {
  "api_version": "1.4.3",
  "block_header": null,
  "merkle_proof": "[80252 hex chars]",
  "stored_value": {
   "CLValue": {
    "bytes": "0A00000043617370657254657374",
    "cl_type": "String",
    "parsed": "CasperTest"
   }
  }
 }
}

```
